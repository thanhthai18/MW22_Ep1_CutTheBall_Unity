    // The differerence between the two is this singleton remains constantly through scenes, 
    // therefore its data stays in memory all the time unless getting disposed properly.
    // In contrast with it, the MonoSingleton only exists in a scene, and once a new scene loaded,
    // everything belongs to that MonoSingleton will be got rid.
    // ==> Final thought: This project initially intented not to use this kind of Singleton design 'cause 
    // it's not a good design generally. That said, things have been settled, use this Singleton design properly!
