    m_Localized: " The player's task is to swipe the all in any direction to hit
      it. The kicked ball bursts. In addition to the balls, there will be bombs on
      the field. They are designed to confuse the player, because if the player mistakenly
      swipes the bomb, it will explode and the game will be over, regardless of the
      number of lives.\n\n Also, the game will be over if the player misses the ball
      and fails to kick it in time. In this case the player has three lives, with
      3 missed ball the game is over. This is a points game, depending on how many
      balls a player shoots, that's how many points he gets."
